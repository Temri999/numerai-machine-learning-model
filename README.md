## Overview

Numerai is a hedge fund that crowdsources machine learning models to predict stock market performance. The dataset provided by Numerai is unique in that it is obfuscated to protect proprietary information, making it a challenging and interesting problem for machine learning practitioners.

This repository contains a trained model that can be used to make predictions on the Numerai dataset. The model is saved in a `.pkl` file, which can be loaded using Python's `pickle` or `joblib` libraries.

## Dataset

The Numerai dataset consists of several features that are used to predict the target variable. The dataset is obfuscated, meaning that the features do not directly correspond to real-world financial indicators. The target variable is a continuous value that represents the expected performance of a stock.

### Features
- The dataset contains a large number of features (e.g., `feature_1`, `feature_2`, ..., `feature_n`).
- Each feature is a numerical value that has been obfuscated to protect proprietary information.

### Target
- The target variable is a continuous value that represents the expected performance of a stock.

## Model

The model in this repository is a LightGBM regressor (`LGBMRegressor`) trained on the Numerai dataset. LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is known for its efficiency and accuracy, especially on large datasets.

### Model Details
- **Model Type**: LightGBM Regressor
- **Serialization Format**: `.pkl` (Pickle)
- **Training Data**: Numerai dataset
- **Hyperparameters**: The model was trained with specific hyperparameters optimized for the Numerai dataset.

### Model File
- `hello_numerai.pkl`: The serialized model file containing the trained LightGBM regressor.

## Usage

To use the model, you need to load the `.pkl` file and make predictions on new data. Below is an example of how to load the model and make predictions:

```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load the model
with open('hello_numerai.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Load new data (replace with your actual data)
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature_1': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    'feature_2': [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
    # Add more features as needed
})

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)
